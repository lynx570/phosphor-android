# Including in your project
Blueprint is available via JitPack, so getting it as simple as adding it as a dependency, like this:

1. Add JitPack repository to your root `build.gradle` file
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
2. Add the dependency in your project `build.gradle` file
```gradle
dependencies {
    compile('com.jahirfiquitiva:Blueprint:{latest version}@aar') {
        transitive = true
    }
}
```
where `{latest version}` corresponds to published version in   [![JitPack](https://jitpack.io/v/jahirfiquitiva/Blueprint.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#jahirfiquitiva/Blueprint)
